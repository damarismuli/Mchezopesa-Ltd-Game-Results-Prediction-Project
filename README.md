# Mchezopesa-Ltd-Game-Results-Prediction-Project
#Description
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).
You have two possible approaches (as shown below) given the datasets that will be provided
Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)


a) Specifying the Question

To create a model that that will predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly while comparing the rankings of the teams.



b) Defining the Metric for Success This project will be successful when: 1)We accurately predict the winning team based on the two factors:

To have a model that has an accuracy of 80%.
Have the lowest Root-mean-square deviation(RMSE) score possible.
To accurately predict the winning team based on Home team or away team and on whether or not the game is friendly while comparing the rankings of the teams.


c) Understanding the context

The men's FIFA World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football.It is currently led by Brazil.The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest.The rankings were introduced in December 1992.A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches.The ranking is currently sponsored by Coca-Cola; as such, The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking name is also used

d)Experimental Design
Two datasets:Fifa-ranking.csv and results.csv were provided
The project undertook the following steps:

EDA
Necessary feature engineering 
Check of multicollinearity
Building the model
Cross-validate the models
Computed RMSE
Created residual plots for your models, and assessed their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test
Performed appropriate regressions on the data 
Challenged the solution 

e) Data Relevance

The data provided was enough to handle the project
